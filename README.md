# Prediction-of-Unemployment-Evolution-in-Morocco

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the evolution of unemployment rates in Morocco using machine learning models. It aims to provide insights into how unemployment varies over time and across different socio-economic groups, helping policymakers and researchers anticipate future trends.

The analysis is based on official data from the Haut-Commissariat au Plan (HCP), covering multiple dimensions such as gender, education level, age group, and geographical area (urban/rural).

## Objectives
* Analyze the evolution of unemployment rates in Morocco from 2015 to 2023.
* Explore relationships between unemployment and demographic/economic indicators.
* Build predictive models to forecast unemployment trends up to 2032.
* Compare the performance of three machine learning algorithms:
    * **Ridge Regression**
    * **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
    * **Random Forest Regressor**

## Data Preprocessing
* Validation of data quality (no missing values detected).
* Cleaning and standardization of column names.
* Separation of data into training and testing sets by quarter.
* Normalization and statistical exploration (mean, variance, correlation matrix, visualizations).
